Introduction
This repository contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a comprehensive Hotel Management System. The ERD is a crucial component for understanding the database structure, which is essential for the management and operation of a hotel. It outlines the various entities involved in the system, such as employees, customers, rooms, bookings, and more, along with their attributes and relationships.

The purpose of this ERD is to provide a clear and organized visual representation of the database schema. It helps developers, database administrators, and stakeholders to comprehend how data is interconnected and to ensure that the system is designed for efficient data management and retrieval. This diagram will serve as a blueprint for implementing the database, ensuring that all necessary relationships and constraints are in place to maintain data integrity and support the functionality of the hotel management system.
